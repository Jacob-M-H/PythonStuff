__New__ : Called when trying to create an instance of a class. Used explicitly when wanting to control/limit the initialization of a new instance.
__Init__: Called after __New__. Initalizes Instance AFTER it has been created. 
#NOTE: Therefore __New__ allows us to avoid allocating memory if parameters are bad.
