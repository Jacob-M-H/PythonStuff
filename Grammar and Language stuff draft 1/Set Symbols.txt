<=expr: #COMMENT Expr are actions, by placing expr in this order, default actions can be collated in one spot for editing. #COMMENT without actions then we just do the recursion basically. | NUMBER | set | x=term '+' y=term { Add(x,y) }
>= #COMMENT CONVENTION, terminals should be written on the left, while operates expecting a secondary argument (such as { '}', or x + '5', these secondary 'arg' should be on the right, but terminals should be on the left, so x+5 should have X 5^+, as the plus is either expecting or should apply to above?)
